    <h2>Volcano</h2>
    <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, 
        that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below
        the surface. On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging
         or converging, and because most of Earth's plate boundaries are underwater, most volcanoes
          are found underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has
           volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has 
           volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there 
           is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and
            the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America. Volcanism
             away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the 
             coreâ€“mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep within Earth. This results in
              hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspotis an example. Volcanoes are usually
               not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.</p>
